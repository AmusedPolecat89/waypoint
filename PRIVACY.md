# Privacy Policy

Waypoint is a local-first browser extension designed to help users remember where they left off while reading or watching anime, manga, novels, and webcomics.

## Data Collection

Waypoint does not collect, store, or transmit personal information.

The extension only accesses webpage content (such as page titles, URLs, and progress indicators) **when the user explicitly chooses to add or update a work**. This data is used solely to save the user’s progress.

All user data is stored locally on the user’s device using the browser’s storage APIs.

## Data Usage

Waypoint does not:
- Collect personal identifiers (name, email address, IP address)
- Track browsing history in the background
- Monitor user activity such as clicks or keystrokes
- Display advertisements
- Sell or transfer user data to third parties

External network requests are made only to public metadata services (such as AniList, MyAnimeList, MangaDex, or Open Library) to retrieve titles and cover images. No user-identifying data is sent with these requests.

## Data Sharing

Waypoint does not share user data with third parties.

## Data Retention

User data remains on the user’s device until the user deletes it or removes the extension.

## User Control

Users may export or delete all stored data at any time through the extension’s settings.

## Changes

This privacy policy may be updated if the extension’s functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected in this document.

## Contact
