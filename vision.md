# Vision

## What this project is

This project exists to solve a simple but persistent problem:

**People lose their place.**

Across novels, web comics, manga, and anime, progress is usually tied to:
- fragile URLs,
- single websites,
- proprietary platforms,
- or scattered tools that don’t talk to each other.

When a site changes, shuts down, or you switch devices, your place is lost.

This extension treats **progress as first-class data** — independent of where content happens to be hosted today.

---

## Core philosophy

### 1. Content-first, not site-first
This tool tracks *works*, not URLs.

A bookmark is not:
> “this link”

It is:
> “this story, at this point”

Links are optional hints — never the source of truth.

---

### 2. Local-first, user-owned data
Your data lives on your device by default.

- No accounts required
- No mandatory cloud
- No hidden sync
- No telemetry

Optional backups (e.g. Google Drive) exist for **your convenience**, not as a dependency.

If this project disappears tomorrow, your data should still be usable.

---

### 3. Explicit over implicit
Nothing happens silently.

- No background scraping
- No auto-tracking without consent
- No guessing without the ability to correct it

The user should always be able to:
- see what is stored
- edit it
- export it
- delete it

Trust is built through transparency, not automation magic.

---

### 4. Boring reliability beats clever features
This tool aims to be **dependable**, not flashy.

The core experience must always be:
- fast
- predictable
- undoable
- hard to corrupt

Advanced features should never compromise the fundamentals.

---

## What “10/10 UI & UX” means here

### UI principles
- Calm, neutral visuals
- No visual noise
- Minimal color used with intent
- Typography optimized for long-term use
- Interfaces that feel at home next to content, not on top of it

No gimmicks. No novelty for novelty’s sake.

---

### UX principles
- Common actions should take **one click**
- Rare actions should be discoverable, not hidden
- Power features should never block casual use
- The interface should explain itself without a tutorial

If a feature needs documentation to be usable, the UX needs improvement.

---

### Respect attention
This tool should:
- never interrupt content
- never demand engagement
- never nag

It exists to *remember*, not to compete for focus.

---

## What this project explicitly is NOT

- Not a piracy tool
- Not a media host
- Not a recommendation engine
- Not a social network
- Not a replacement for content platforms

It does not promise to find content for you.
It promises to **remember where you were**.

---

## Progress as durable memory

A progress entry should survive:
- site shutdowns
- URL changes
- platform migrations
- years of time

Even if content cannot be resolved automatically, the record remains:

> *This work. This point. This moment.*

That alone has value.

---

## Community-first by design

This project is open-source because:
- no single person can anticipate every site or workflow
- community adapters and importers are inevitable
- forks and experimentation are healthy

The goal is not control.
The goal is a **shared, trusted baseline** people can build on.

---

## Sustainability without lock-in

The project may be distributed through paid storefronts for convenience.
The code remains open.
The features remain the same.

Payment is for:
- easier installation
- automatic updates
- supporting ongoing maintenance

No artificial feature walls.
No “pro-only data.”

---

## Long-term success looks like this

- People recommend it without hesitation
- It quietly replaces spreadsheets, notes, and fragile bookmarks
- It still works years later
- It earns trust by never betraying it
- The maintainer uses it daily

If this tool disappears, users should feel grateful it existed — not trapped by it.

---

## Final note

This project is built because the maintainer needs it.

That is intentional.

Tools maintained out of personal necessity tend to:
- age better
- respect users more
- avoid unnecessary complexity

If this project becomes useful to others, that is the best possible outcome.
